# Session 3: Working with Germplasm

Getting help 

If you’re ever stuck while using Germinate, use the help buttons throughout the interface to get more information about the current page or functionality. This feature will explain the interface components or the content of the page in more detail. 

Showing and hiding columns 

Tables within Germinate show lots of information. Sometimes, you will only be interested in a specific part of this information and hiding table columns is one way to allow you to focus better. Use the dropdown button in the top left of any table to select the columns you wish to show or hide. 

Selecting how many entries to show 

Another way to change how data is displayed in tables is changing the number of rows that are shown at a time. By default, Germinate only shows a small number of rows the reduce the amount of scrolling required to take in all the information. To show more rows per page, select a different value from the dropdown menu in the top right of the table. The display will refresh and now show the requested number of rows. 

Sorting and filtering the germplasm table 

All tables within Germinate can be sorted or filtered by any of the columns you see. Sorting happens by clicking on a table header and another click on the same column inverts the sorting direction. Filtering is a very useful tool when searching for specific data points. In this example, we are looking at the germplasm table. The filtering dialog is opened by clicking the filter button in the top left of the table. Here, search criteria for each column can be defined and combined allowing simple searches as well as complex queries. To search for germplasm with a certain species, select the species column from the dropdown and then enter the species. This filter can be combined with a search for germplasm from a specific country resulting in only germplasm with the combination of species and country of origin to be displayed in the resulting table. 

The germplasm table also has a section with common filtering options for easier access just above the table. 

Accessions Plants/Plots and Samples 

Germplasm in Germinate is stored at different levels: ‘Accession’, ‘Plant/Plot’ and ‘Sample’ called ‘entity types’. Plant/plot level material is usually derived from accession germplasm and samples can be taken from either plant/plot or accession level. 

What data is available 

The germplasm table has dedicated columns that indicate the types of data available for a germplasm. This is shown by the corresponding icon in each column. The same applies to images where an icon will be shown if images are available and clicking on that icon will show one of the images as an example. 

Adding things to marked lists 

Browsing and filtering tables is usually done to look for germplasm, markers or locations. Once these are found they can be added to a personalised ‘marked list’ akin to a shopping basket. Simply add items to the basket by marking the checkbox in the last column either individually or for the whole table using the column header. 

Passport page 

The passport page of a germplasm is where all information available for this germplasm is aggregated in a single location. Meta-data, pedigrees, location information, images, and data availability are all easily accessible from here.

Mark or unmark germplasm 

 

Tasks: 

Go to the germplasm page. Try hiding/showing some columns. 

Using the table filtering, search for germplasm collected in country X. 

With the table filtering active, sort the table by collection date in ascending order. What is the first germplasm in the table? 

Using the marking mechanism, mark the first four germplasm in the table. 

Navigate to the passport page of X, what is Y?
