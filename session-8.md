# Session 8: Geographic Data

f you ever find yourself searching for a germplasm, a marker, a trait, or a location but you don’t know the exact name, then the Germinate-wide search is where you’ll find it. Simply type in a name-fragment into the search box at the top of the page and hit enter. The search page will open and let you define what you’re looking for. You can either search all data types or for any type individually. 

A click on the button starts the search and the results will be grouped into data type specific tables. So, if you’re searching for a location name, you will see germplasm collected at this location as well as trials conducted at a location. Searching for a germplasm identifier will show the germplasm passport data as well as all trials and compound data recorded for this germplasm. 

 

Tasks: 

Looking at the traits page, how many traits are in this Germinate database? 

Sorting by the data points column, which trait has the most data points and how many? 

Select trait X (categorical), which value appears most often? 

Navigate to the trials export page and select the first two datasets. Using the overview statistics, which dataset has the higher average trait X? 

Download the data using the last tab. Using Flapjack’s data loading dialog, load the trait data into Flapjack along with the genotypic data from the previous tutorial.
