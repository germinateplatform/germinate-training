# Session 5: Working with Groups

Mention now that the reason we are doing this is so that we can export for use in other tools. 

In many cases, people do not want to download all the available data, but only a specific subset of interest. To facilitate this, Germinate offers a mechanism called “groups”. These groups are used to define meaningful subsets of germplasm, markers and locations. During any export mechanism, groups can be selected to limit the visualization or download to just the items within the group.  

As an example from the Crop Wild Relatives project, all germplasm collected in the wild can be grouped together to simplify the export of phenotypic and genotypic data restricted to CWRs. 

Groups are either pre-defined or can be created by users if authentication is enabled. 

Let’s see what this looks like in practice. In this example, we have X germplasm groups. [Explain the individual groups]. When selecting a phenotypic dataset, these groups can be selected on any visualization to only show data for these groups. On the download page, these groups are also available to restrict the download to germplasm from these groupings. 

 

Tasks: 

Navigate to the groups page. How many groups are there in total? 

How many of them are germplasm groups? 

Sort the germplasm groups by their size, how many germplasm are in the largest group?
