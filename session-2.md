# Session 2: The Germinate Web Interface

This tutorial will guide you through the main components of the Germinate interface. All Germinate databases have the same user interface so if you become familiar with one, you are familiar with them all. 

Navigation between data categories is always found here, search is always found here, and here and tools to allow you to change interface languages or look at what's in marked lists are always here. Marked lists act like a shopping basket for germplasm in Germinate and we go over that in greater detail in another video. We have the Germinate interface translated into a couple of languages including English, German and Spanish and this can be changed here. 

You can do some other cool things too. Like dark themes? well we have you covered and the latest Germinate version now supports a dark colour theme – perfect for those late nights working!  

Some of the exports that you can do with Germinate may take a couple of minutes to run and Germinate now support asynchronous downloads. This means that you can request data then go and do something else with Germinate. When the data is ready the interface will let you know and you can download the data from here – no more hanging about waiting on data. 

What about giving yourself a bit more room to play with? Well, we can do that too by clicking here, it’s a toggle so have a play about and see what works for you. 

This short tutorial has highlighted some of the cool features that Germinate offers but the best way is to just dive in and start having an explore!
