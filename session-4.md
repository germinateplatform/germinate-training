# Session 4: Experiments, Datasets and other Data Resources

Germinate holds large amounts of experimental data. These can include data from phenotypic trials, genotypic SNP data, chemical compound information and climate measurements. Datasets are the smallest grouping of data in Germinate and represent a single unit of data like a single field trial. The datasets page shows all datasets stored in Germinate. Clicking on the dataset name will take you to the corresponding data export pages. The icon buttons at the right side of the table will reveal information about collaborators, dataset attributes and download options. 

Experiments group together coherent datasets into meaningful combinations. This way, field trials data can be linked to the corresponding climate data as well as any genotypic data that is linked to it. The dataset type column shows what types of datasets are contained in this experiment. 

Sometimes there is data that cannot be stored in Germinate directly. In those cases, the data can still be uploaded in any format and made available as direct downloads. This means that all your data is still available in a single location. 

 

Tasks: 

How many datasets are available in Germinate? 

How many of those are genotypic datasets?
