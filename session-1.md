# Session 1: Getting Started and Introduction to Germinate

Why use Germinate? 

Germinate allows you to manage data from your collections in a standard and FAIR way. It allows you to explore and make your data available to collaborators via intuitive web-based interfaces. 

The single point of access for all background data on genetic resources collections that Germinate implements provides a valuable digital curation resource as well as offering essential continuity on how new data is recorded, archived, and made available to collaborators and communities. 

What types of data does it store? 

Data types include passport, phenotypic, field trial, pedigree, genetic, climatic, and geographic location data as well as user‐submitted annotations and images. 

Where is Germinate developed? 

Germinate has been developed by the Information and Computational Sciences Department at the James Hutton Institute just outside of Dundee in Scotland and we welcome any contributions to the project. Originally Germinate was created to meet the needs of barley and potato work being carried out in Scotland. 

How long has Germinate been in development? 

Germinate was originally the subject of a publication in 2005 but it has advanced considerably since then. From originally only storing a few markers and germplasm entries we now have databases with hundreds of thousands of plant lines and millions of SNP markers and phenotype data points. We have two recent papers that describe Germinates transformation. 

What species use Germinate? 

We have a wide and varied list of crops that use Germinate – everything from barley to sweet cherry! 

Does Germinate support standards? 

Germinate is fully compliant with the Multi‐Crop Passport Descriptors developed by the FAO and we are developing support for data initiatives such as MIAPPE and Dublin Core. Germinate aims and supports making data available using FAIR principles and we are working to include DOI features and tools for datasets and germplasm. 

Once my data is in Germinate how do I get it out? 

Germinate offers different formats to download your data from plain text format to formats specific for external analysis programs. One of our main underlying beliefs is that any data you put in – you can get back out again quickly and there are tools to give you an overview of the data that your database contains. Have a play about with our demo database to get a better understanding of the tools Germinate provides - don’t worry you can't break anything! 

Can I install it myself? 

Of course! You can download Germinate from our GitHub repository or using a handy Docker image to get up and running quickly. You can even use it on your Raspberry Pi! 

If you just want to have a quick play about with the interface you can use one of the publicly available databases or our demo database which has examples of all data types. 

That’s great how can I get more information? 

Contact us, please get in touch and we can give an extended demo or talk you through using Germinate with your data or how you can help be part of the Germinate community! 

 

Video 2 Getting started 

Logging in and creating a Germinate account (where required) 

While most Germinate databases are available to the public there may occasionally be the need to protect your database, perhaps while its being created or to share with collaborators for testing before getting ready to make your data public. 

In order to achieve this, Germinate allows you to password protect your installation so that only authenticated users can log into the system. This can of course be changed later. 

So how do you access a Germinate database that has password protection. Firstly, you need to navigate to your Germinate page then enter your username and password details then click here to sign in.  

If you don’t have a username and password, you can click here to register. Each Germinate installation may have specific terms and conditions that you need to agree to before you can get access to the data. Click to accept these terms and conditions then click next. If you already have another Germinate account that makes things bit simpler – all we need is your email and password. If not then you need to fill in your details then click register. 

Passwords should meet these minimum criteria:  

Passwords should be unguessable. There is an indicator below the password field showing how strong your password is. 

Your details will then be passed to the Germinate administrator for your database who can approve user accounts. If you lose your password, don’t worry as we can reset that by clicking here – a link which allows you to reset your password will then be sent to the email address you used to register on the system – follow this link to create a new password then log in as normal to the system.
